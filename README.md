# remove_string_from_files
Removes a string from all filenames in the directory


Upon opening the executable, it asks for a string to remove. Upon entering the string you desire to remove, it will look at every file in the directory to see if it has the specified string. If it does, remove the string from the filename. Turns out this is quite useful if you have 100s or 1000s or maybe even 100s of 1000s of files you need to process relatively quickly. 


Example scenario: You have 3528 files all prefixed with 'Exported File - ' and you want to remove this. Simply run the program, enter the string, and it will fix the names. Simple. This has saved me probably hours of renaming files in a very similar scenario!

Hope this is useful to at least someone.
